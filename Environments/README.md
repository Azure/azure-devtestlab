# Azure DevTest Labs Environments

This folder represents the Azure DevTest Labs Public Environment Repo, as shown in the Azure Portal.

For information about [environments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/lab-services/devtest-lab-concepts#environment) and how they can be leveraged in Azure DevTest Labs, refer to [Configure and use public environments in Azure DevTest Labs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/lab-services/devtest-lab-configure-use-public-environments).

## Contributions

Contributions to the Public Environment Repo are limited to corrections in the existing code base. At times, new environments will be welcome. However, the team reserves the right to decide which contributions will be accepted.

The process to get changes published requires the team to review the code submissions and test the environment contributions or the changes. Submit a pull request to get the process started.

### Submission Requirements

Create a pull request that includes
* __a single environment per pull request__,
* a detailed description of the new contribution or the change,
* steps on how to test the environment and/or changes,
* screenshots of the expected output, where possible, from your own testing, and
* a top level `README.md` document with details about the environment (for new contributions).
