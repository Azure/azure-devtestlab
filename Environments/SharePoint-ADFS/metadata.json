  "description": "This template deploys SharePoint 2013, 2016 and 2019. Each SharePoint version is independent, user chooses which one to deploy individually and can deploy all simultaneously. A DC is provisioned and configured with ADFS and ADCS, and a unique SQL Server is provisioned for all SharePoint farms. Farms are optimized for running integration tests: minimum configuration to provision quickly, but still viable to cover most scenarios.",
