SharePoint 2013 SP1 Setup

There are three scripts the initial script is to determine the .Net version and start the SharePoint 2013 setup.  
If the .Net is newer than 4.5 a second script will adjust the registry keys to allow setup to run.
The third script will revert the keys back to the original data.
