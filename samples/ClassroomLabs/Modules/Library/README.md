# Az.LabServices

![AllTests](https://github.com/Azure/azure-devtestlab/workflows/AllTests/badge.svg)

Az.LabServices is a PowerShell module to simplify the management of [Azure Lab services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/lab-services/). It provides composable functions to create, query, update and delete lab accounts, labs, VMs and Images.

Here is an example that showcases using the library to stop all the running VMs in all labs.

```powershell
Get-AzLabAccount | Get-AzLab | Get-AzLabVm -Status Running | Stop-AzLabVm
```

And [here](HowTo.md) is a step by step tutorial.
