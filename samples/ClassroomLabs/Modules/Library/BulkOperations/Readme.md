# Bulk Lab Creation Module <!-- omit in toc -->

>### Azure Lab Services April 2022 update (preview)
>If you are using the update (with lab plans) the [Lab Services module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az.LabServices/0.1.0) is available in the PowerShell gallery.  There is a dedicated [Lab Services repository](https://github.com/Azure/LabServices) with samples for the updated modules and the improved service.


The [Az.LabServices.BulkOperations.psm1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-devtestlab/blob/master/samples/ClassroomLabs/Modules/Library/BulkOperations/Az.LabServices.BulkOperations.psm1) module enables bulk operations on **Resource Groups**, **Lab Accounts** and **Labs** via commandline based on declarative configuration information. The standard pattern of usage is by composing a pipeline as follows:

`Load configuration info from db/csv/...` => `Transform configuration info` => `Publish the labs`

## Getting Started
The [Bulk Lab Creation functions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-devtestlab/tree/master/samples/ClassroomLabs/Modules/Library/Tools) can be run from an authenticated Azure PowerShell session and requires [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases) and the [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/) module.  The script will automatically install the [ThreadJob](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/threadjob)  Powershell Module.

To get started, using the example configuration csv files:

1. Get a local copy of the LabCreator.ps1 script by either [cloning the repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-devtestlab.git) or by [downloading a copy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-devtestlab/master/samples/ClassroomLabs/Modules/Library/BulkOperations/Az.LabServices.BulkOperations.psm1)
1. Get a local copy of the example [hogwarts.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-devtestlab/master/samples/ClassroomLabs/Modules/Library/Tools/hogwarts.csv) file and example [charms.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-devtestlab/master/samples/ClassroomLabs/Modules/Library/Tools/charms.csv) file
1. Launch a PowerShell session
1. Ensure [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps) installed
1. Update the example CSV files to configure the resources to be created.  For additional labs, create additional lines in the CSV file.  The CSV files can be modified directly with Microsoft Excel.
1. Import the functions in the script by typing:
```powershell
Import-Module .\Az.LabServices.BulkOperations.psm1
```

## Examples
The functions are generic and can be composed together to achieve different aims. In the following examples, we load the configuration information from a CSV file. The examples work the same if the information is loaded from a database. You need to substitute the first function with a database retrieving one.

The examples scripts expect the modules used to be in the following directories:

```powershell
Import-Module ../../Az.LabServices.psm1 -Force
Import-Module ../Az.LabServices.BulkOperations.psm1 -Force
```

The full code for the example is immediately after the title in parenthesis.

### Publish all the labs in a CSV file ([Examples/PublishAll.ps1](./Examples/PublishAll.ps1))

```powershell
".\hogwarts.csv" | Import-LabsCsv | Publish-Labs
```
* `Import-LabsCsv` loads the configuration information from the csv file. It also loads schedule information for each lab from a separate file.
* `Publish-Labs` publishes the labs and it is the natural end to all our pipelines. You can specify how many concurrent threads to use with the parameter `ThrottleLimit`.

### Publish all the labs in a JSON file ([Examples/PublishAllJson.ps1](./Examples/PublishAllJson.ps1))
You can store your configuration information in JSON form as well (i.e., file, Azure CosmoDb, other).

```powershell
Get-Content -Raw -Path "hogwarts.json" | ConvertFrom-Json | Publish-Labs
```

### Publish all the labs with a particular tag ([Examples/PublishByTag.ps1](./Examples/PublishByTag.ps1))

```powershell
".\hogwarts.csv"  | Import-LabsCsv | Select-Lab -SomeTags Maths, Science | Publish-Labs
```

In the example csv configuration file, the `Tags` column contains the emails of the professors that are giving a certain course. You can create the labs for a particular professor with:

```powershell
".\hogwarts.csv"  | Import-LabsCsv | Select-Lab -SomeTags bool1@hotmail.com | Publish-Labs
```

* `Select-Lab` is just a convenience function. You can achieve the same result by using any of the `Powershell` provided selection functions (i.e., `Where-Object`).
 
### Publish one lab with a given id ([Examples/PublishById.ps1](./Examples/PublishById.ps1))

```powershell
".\hogwarts.csv"  | Import-LabsCsv | Select-Lab -AnId id001 | Publish-Labs
```

### Publish one lab changing some configuration properties (i.e. a staging ResourceGroup)([Examples/PublishStaging.ps1](./Examples/PublishStaging.ps1))

```powershell
".\hogwarts.csv" `
  | Import-LabsCsv `
  | Select-Lab -Id id001 `
  | Set-LabProperty -ResourceGroupName Staging -MaxUsers 50 `
  | Publish-Labs
```

* You can use any of the `Select-*` functions to choose labs. All the chosen labs will be modified by the `Set-LabProperty` function.

### Show a menu asking to select one lab ([Examples/PickALab.ps1](./Examples/PickALab.ps1))

```console
".\hogwarts.csv" | Import-LabsCsv | Show-LabMenu -PickLab | Publish-Labs

LABS
[0]     id001   hogwarts-rg2    History of Magic
[1]     id002   hogwarts-rg2    Transfiguration
[2]     id003   hogwarts-rg2    Charms
Please select the lab to create:
```

* The fields displayed for the various labs are fixed. Log an issue if you want me to make them configurable.

### Show a menu to the user asking for the value of some properties ([Examples/PickProperties.ps1](./Examples/PickProperties.ps1))

```console
".\hogwarts.csv" `
  | Import-LabsCsv `
  | Show-LabMenu -Properties LabName,MaxUsers `
  | Publish-Labs

LabName: TestLab
MaxUsers: 10
```

### Show a menu to the user asking to select a lab and the value of some properties([Examples/PickLabAndProperties.ps1](./Examples/PickLabAndProperties.ps1))

```console
".\hogwarts.csv" `
  | Import-LabsCsv `
  | Show-LabMenu -PickLab -Properties LabName,MaxUsers `
  | Publish-Labs

LABS
[0]     id001   hogwarts-rg2    History of Magic
[1]     id002   hogwarts-rg2    Transfiguration
[2]     id003   hogwarts-rg2    Charms
Please select the lab to create: 0
LabName: MyName
MaxUsers: 30
```

## Virtual Machine Sizes
The Azure Portal shows sizes with a friendly name when creating a lab and the API takes specific strings that map to those friendly names.  Listed below is the mapping between these.  More information can be found in the [Lab Services Admin Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/lab-services/administrator-guide#vm-sizing) which includes information on the VM series.
Friendly Name                  | API Size
-------------------------------|------------------------
Small                          | Basic
Medium                         | Standard
Medium (nested virtualization) | Virtualization
Large                          | Large
Large (nested virtualization)  | Performance
Small GPU (visualization)      | SmallGPUVisualization  
Small GPU (Compute)            | SmallGPUCompute
Medium GPU (visualization)     | MediumGPUVisualization
