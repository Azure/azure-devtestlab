# Here the test is made multi-thread safe by making sure to examine and delete just the objects that were created inside the test
# The worst that can happen is that it crashes after having created objects without deleting them, leaving garbage inside the common lab
# But that doesn't impede the subsequent tests to run fine as they create their own objects,
# but we might want to do a periodic clean up (nightly?) not to waste resources
