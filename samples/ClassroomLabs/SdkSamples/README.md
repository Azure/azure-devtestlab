# How to set up a simple app to use the .NET SDK for Azure Lab Services
- Login to portal.azure.com
- Go to the "Azure Active Directory" blade and click Properties. Copy the Directory ID to your notes. It will be used as the TenantId in the app.config.
- Go back to the "Azure Active Directory" blade and Click "App Registrations"
- Click "New Application Registration"
	- Name doesn't matter, but make sure you select NATIVE as the Application type.
	- Set the sign-on URL to https://dtlclient. This doesn't matter much right now either.
- When that's completed, go to the registered app page for your new app
	- Copy the "ApplicationID" to your notes. It will be used as the ClientId in the app.config.
	- Go to "Settings/Owners" and add both your account as an owner.
	- Go to "Settings/Redirect URIs" and make sure "https://dtlclient" is on there.
	- Go to "Settings/Required Permissions" and click Add. Type in "Windows Azure Service Management API" and check all permissions boxes.
	- On "Settings/Required Permissions" click "Grant Permissions". This should succeed.
- Next up, we can actually go create a lab account to make SDK calls against. Go to the Lab Services blade and create a new LabAccount.
- Once that LabAccount has been created, go to "Access Control (IAM)" and add your account as an owner of the lab account.
- Now you can make set the rest of the options in the App.Config and start making SDK calls!
