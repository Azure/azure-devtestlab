This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Setting up the client app
1. Make sure you have an App Registration created for your client app in Azure Active Directory (AAD).
2. Copy the application (client) ID and directory (tenant) ID from your App Registration into the `.env` file:
```
REACT_APP_AAD_CLIENT_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
REACT_APP_AAD_TENANT_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```
