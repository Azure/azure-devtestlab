DevTest Labs provides a central place for you to see all your lab virtual machines, as well as convenient way to connect to them.  Clicking the ‘Connect’ button on Lab Virtual Machine blade will create a machine-specific RDP file that can be opened and used to connect to the lab machine.  DevTest Labs supports using token authentication to the gateway machine which allows users to connect to their lab virtual machines without having the RDP port exposed to the internet for that lab machine.  This sample provides ARM templates and scripts to setup an example remote desktop gateway machines and a lab that uses token authentication to connect to lab machines.
